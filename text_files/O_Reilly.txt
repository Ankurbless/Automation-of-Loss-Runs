•They have standalone pollution policy.
Legionnaire’s nor pesticide/herbicide coverage
needed for hotels/golf.
•SAM is silent
For the hotels, each brand requires their own
Human Trafficking training at hire and it’s
administered through their individual intranet
platforms – this includes Marriott, Hilton, IHG &
Choice properties. It’s my understanding that
this is required both at hire and annually as a
refresher.
We also have mentioned in our Safety Training SOP
that any non-branded hotels need to complete OHM
provided Human Trafficking training in January,
however we don’t have any unbranded hotels in our
portfolio at this time. We don’t have any
requirements for our restaurant/entertainment
venues. We are still having conversations with
PACT (Matt has been working on the sublicense
agreement back and forth) to have our own human
trafficking curriculum that we can provide any
unbranded hotels we acquire or if we want to
start requiring this training for our non-hotel
properties.

Regarding the Property Workbook document
attached: Management Fees from the OHM tab are
also listed on the Property Exposures – SOV tab
where the rating detail is located. You do not
want to include the $8,203,016 from line 34 in
the GL rating since the insured is responsible
for all GL coverage for both managed and/or owned
locations. No property managed class code needed
for the OHM operations.
