EXPOSURES: (continued)
Golf Course - Golf Carts on the course would not
be licensed for road use so covered under GL. 1
golf course (but will confirm this one is not
being managed by Marriott also). Alcohol is
served.
Resorts: There is a SPA at Pelican Hill but the
resort is now managed as a Marriott property.
They do own the CRC marinas in Newport Beach.
Retail Centers: They have a security ops center
than is monitored 24/7 by 6 analysts. All of
their security is contracted our to Allied
Universal.
Contract requires 6m GL limits (but suspect they
carry much more) including AL, PNC and WOS
language. No armed guards. There are cameras in
most apartments, offices and some retail that are
being monitored. 17 rover vehicles that patrol
around the area and can be dispatched quickly to
an incident or report. There is a ferris wheel at
Irvine Spectrum. I am not aware that they host
any major/big-time events but on their website
they do show smaller events that happen at the
